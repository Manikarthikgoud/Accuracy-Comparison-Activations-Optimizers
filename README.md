# Multi-Layer Perceptron for Human Activity Recognition

## Description

This project involves implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify human activities based on data from smartphones. The model's accuracy is evaluated across various activation functions and optimizers.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Human Activity Recognition database. It was created from recordings of 30 study participants performing daily activities while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The goal is to classify activities into one of six categories.
